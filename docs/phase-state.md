# Phase state — authoritative resume point

## New-session recovery protocol (do this before modifying anything)

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/product-vision.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and this
   file.
2. Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -15`. Confirm the branch and last
   checkpoint below match Git. If they disagree, stop and resolve that
   first.
3. Read the current phase design (`docs/phase1/design.md`, including
   "Operator decisions" and "Review resolutions", which take precedence)
   and `docs/ADR/`.
4. Continue from **Next steps**. Never assume an earlier conversation is
   available.

No secrets are kept here. The production connection string exists only in
the operator's shell (`DB_URL`), and client config is in `.env.local`
(git-ignored).

## Current

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Roadmap phase | **Phase 1 — Database and security foundation** (design approved 2026-09-26) |
| Sub-phase | Setup done (product docs, pinned CLI). Next: **CP1 local DB test harness** |
| Branch | `feature/phase1-db-hardening`. Backup pushes to origin are allowed for this branch only: no force push, no PR, no merge, no tags |
| Last verified checkpoint | see `git log -1` on the branch; setup checkpoint follows CP0 `7bd8557` |
| Next human gate | None until the first **production** operation or the Phase 1 completion report. The team works autonomously inside the approved phase |

## Operating model (operator, 2026-09-26)

- The team executes the approved phase without per-change approval. That
  covers code, tests, local migrations, local DB testing, refactors in
  scope, review fixes, docs, and local checkpoint commits plus backup
  pushes of this branch.
- **Stop for the human before:**
  - the next roadmap phase, or a material scope or architecture change;
  - a major new dependency;
  - **anything on the production Supabase project** (history repair,
    migrations, data fixes, auth/security config, operator ownership
    release);
  - destructive Git operations, force-pushes, merges, PRs;
  - production deploys;
  - anything with billing;
  - deleting SplitChat-Dev.
- Each production operation or declared batch needs its evidence package
  (design "Operator decisions"), then explicit execution approval.

## Key decisions for continuation

- Design: `docs/phase1/design.md` (approved) and ADR-0001…0007 (Accepted).
- G1: members browse active members only. Historical names come from
  `get_ledger_identities(group)`: ledger-referenced users only, display name
  only.
- G2: no Admin role; roles are Owner and Member.
- G3: Supabase CLI pinned `supabase@2.117.0` (devDependency). No Docker.
  Use `--db-url`.
- G4: one free SplitChat-Dev project is approved (no billing, no prod data
  or secrets). Not yet created; needs the operator's Supabase login or
  access token.
- G5: hosting is undecided. M10/M14 are blocked for prod until a compatible
  frontend deployment exists.
- M16 is deferred to Phase 8.
- Tests:
  - Tier 1: a disposable local PG17 cluster plus a Supabase shim, run by
    `npm run test:db`, with the positive-target guard (DS-8).
  - Tier 2: SplitChat-Dev.
  - Production is never used for tests.

## Completed

- Phase 0 baseline `cb2db08` (pushed, on `chore/capture-schema-baseline`).
- CP0 `7bd8557`: Phase 1 design, ADRs, phase-state.
- Setup: `docs/product-vision.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`; design approval and
  G1–G5/M16 decisions recorded in design and ADRs; pinned Supabase CLI
  2.117.0 installed (`migration list/repair`, `db push` support
  `--db-url`); `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities.

## In progress

- Nothing uncommitted.

## Next steps (design §E)

1. **CP1** harness: `scripts/db-test.mjs` (positive-target guard,
   `initdb` temp cluster), `tests/db/shim` + self-test, `tests` helpers,
   seed, `npm run test:db`.
2. **CP2** M0 baseline migration, round-trip diff proof, characterisation
   tests.
3. CP3+ M1…M15 per design §B. SplitChat-Dev rehearsal before any prod
   batch. Needed for M11 (CA-2).

## Validation status

At the setup checkpoint: lint ✅, build ✅ (known >500 kB chunk warning),
test ✅ 84/84, npm audit ✅ 0. `test:db` doesn't exist yet (CP1).

## Unresolved risks

- **Production, all pre-existing and unchanged (nothing live has been
  modified):**
  - CRITICAL QS-1 cross-group expense move;
  - CRITICAL QS-2 anon membership oracle;
  - HIGH QS-3 split-sum bypass;
  - HIGH QS-4 owner-deletion cascade;
  - MEDIUM: blanket grants incl. TRUNCATE, email enumeration,
    remainder-cent order mismatch.
- **Project:**
  - no migration history on prod;
  - no CI;
  - CA-2 (triggers on `auth.users` allowed?) unproven;
  - SplitChat-Dev not created yet;
  - prod can't be fixed until a production batch is approved.

## Working-tree notes

`src/pages/ActivityPage.tsx`, `AuthPage.tsx` and `DashboardPage.tsx` show as
modified, but only line endings differ. Never stage, commit or reset them.
