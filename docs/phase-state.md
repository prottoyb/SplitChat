# Phase state — authoritative resume point

## New-session recovery protocol (do this before modifying anything)

1. Read `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/product-vision.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and this
   file.
2. Run `git status` and `git log --oneline -15`. Confirm the branch and last
   checkpoint below match Git. If they disagree, stop and resolve that
   first.
3. Read the current phase design (`docs/phase1/design.md`, including
   "Operator decisions" and "Review resolutions", which take precedence)
   and `docs/ADR/`.
4. Continue from **Next steps**. Never assume an earlier conversation is
   available.

No secrets are kept here. The production connection string exists only in
the operator's shell (`DB_URL`), and client config is in `.env.local`
(git-ignored).

## Current

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Roadmap phase | **Autonomous programme Phases 2–7** (operator approval 2026-09-27; stop before Phase 8, production writes or deploys). Phase 2 **COMPLETE** (`docs/phase2/plan.md`; QA PASS, Senior APPROVE). **Current: Phase 3 — Dashboard and activity** (architecture: ADR-0009 activity model under review) |
| Production | Complete Phase 1 state: M0–M15 + `20260927135000` (17 versions). Phases 2–7 make **no production writes or deploys**; production-required changes accumulate into reviewed release batches |
| Branch | `feature/phase2-frontend-domain` (from `main` @ `02d6d64`, the Phase 1 merge). Backup pushes of the current development branch allowed; no force push; `main` pushes are the operator's (git-guard) |
| Last verified checkpoint | the Phase 1 completion commit at the branch head (`git log -1`) |
| Next human gate | End of Phase 7 (programme report), or any listed exception: material scope/architecture change, new major dependency/service, billing, production DB write, production Auth/security config, production deploy, destructive Git, irreversible external operation, product-behaviour ambiguity |

## Operating model (operator, 2026-09-26)

- The team executes the approved phase without per-change approval. That
  covers code, tests, local migrations, local DB testing, refactors in
  scope, review fixes, docs, and local checkpoint commits plus backup
  pushes of this branch.
- **Stop for the human before:**
  - the next roadmap phase, or a material scope or architecture change;
  - a major new dependency;
  - **anything on the production Supabase project** (history repair,
    migrations, data fixes, auth/security config, operator ownership
    release);
  - destructive Git operations, force-pushes, merges, PRs;
  - production deploys;
  - anything with billing;
  - deleting SplitChat-Dev.
- Each production operation or declared batch needs its evidence package
  (design "Operator decisions"), then explicit execution approval.

## Key decisions for continuation

- Design: `docs/phase1/design.md` (approved; "Operator decisions", "Review resolutions" and the batch 3 review record take precedence) and ADR-0001…0007 (Accepted).
- G1: members browse active members only; historical names via `get_ledger_identities(group)` (ledger-referenced users, display name only).
- G2: no Admin role; roles are Owner and Member.
- G3: Supabase CLI pinned `supabase@2.117.0` (devDependency), no Docker, `--db-url` only. The CLI's output depends on agent detection: every tool call pins `--agent no`, and `migration list` is read with `--output-format json` through a strict parser (`scripts/ops/cliOutput.mjs`).
- G4: SplitChat-Dev ref `opviwtyfssxoheigflxw` (free tier). Production ref `jhftlnsccurhfgneltgi`, never targeted by rehearsal tooling. Dev secrets only in git-ignored `.env.splitchat-dev.local`. Deleting SplitChat-Dev needs human approval (an in-place reset was approved once, 2026-09-27: `scripts/rehearsal/reset-dev-to-empty.sql`).
- G5: hosting undecided; **no live frontend** (operator attestation `no-live-frontend` for batches 2, 3a, 3b). Any future deployment must be built from a commit containing `a5ed4e8` (the v2 / integer-cents frontend).
- Production operations are run by the operator in their own PowerShell (`DB_URL` never enters Claude's shell) with `scripts/ops/prod.mjs --batch <id>`; the team prepares the reviewed evidence, commands and reports.
- M16 (index cleanup) is deferred to Phase 8.
- Tests: Tier 1 local PG17 + shim (`npm run test:db`, DS-8 guard); Tier 2 SplitChat-Dev; production is never used for tests.

## Completed (Phase 1)

| Batch | Migrations | Production | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Setup | harness, shim, M0 baseline (exact round-trip), characterisation cases | — | CP0–CP2 |
| 1 | M0 history repair + M1–M5 (immutable expense identity, anon/definer hardening, no direct ledger writes, ledger invariants, owner-cascade interim) | applied + verified (`7fa607e`) | `docs/phase1/batch1-rehearsal.md` |
| 2 | M6–M10 (least privilege, soft membership history + single owner, private helpers / active-member RLS / ledger identities, membership RPCs, no direct membership deletes) | applied + verified (`f32b56d`) | `docs/phase1/batch2-rehearsal.md` |
| 3a | M11 ledger-preserving account deletion, M12 integer cents + canonical split + v2, M13 expense edit/delete, M15 solo-group deletion, `20260927135000` owner-deletion/add-member serialisation | applied + verified 2026-09-27 (from `25b7deb`) | `docs/phase1/batch3-rehearsal.md`, `batch3-approval-report.md` |
| 3b | M14 drop legacy numeric expense RPC | applied + verified 2026-09-27 (from `43e02ed`) | same, `batch3b-approval-report.md` |

Batch 3 was rehearsed twice on SplitChat-Dev, the second time from a clean reset replaying production's full path (M0 identical to the Phase 0 capture → batch 1 → batch 2 → 3a → 3b), with CA-2 26/26 and the race proof 6/6 through real Supabase Auth/PostgREST.

## Next steps

1. Phase 3: decide the activity model (ADR-0009, architect review). A persisted event log is a material database change → operator approval before implementing it; dashboard work that uses existing data proceeds meanwhile.
2. Phases 4–7 follow autonomously, each ending with full validation, both reviews, docs, a verified checkpoint and a push.
3. `main` holds the local Phase 1 merge `02d6d64`; pushing it to `origin/main` is the operator's (`! git push origin main`).

## How to run

- `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, `npm test` (Vitest: `src/**` and `scripts/**/*.test.mjs`), `npm run test:db` (add `-- --case 030`, `-- --keep`, `-- --export-dump <file>`, `-- --export-dump-at <version> <file>`).
- Rehearsal (SplitChat-Dev only): `node scripts/rehearsal/dev.mjs <check|sql|file|readonly|dump|cli ...>`, `api.mjs`, `api-batch2.mjs`, `api-batch3.mjs <prepare|verify3a|verify3b>`, `api-ca2.mjs`, `api-race.mjs`, `compare-dumps.mjs`; the production tool itself with `--rehearse-on-dev`.
- Needs PostgreSQL 17 binaries (default Windows path, or `SPLITCHAT_PG_BIN`).

## Validation status (Phase 1 completion, 2026-09-27)

lint ✅ · build ✅ (known >500 kB chunk warning) · Vitest ✅ **214/214** (13 files) · npm audit ✅ 0 · **test:db ✅** baseline round-trip exact, **16 rollback checks** (M11 up/down only, fix-forward), **23/23 cases, 440 assertions** · production batches 1, 2, 3a, 3b **VERIFY PASSED**.

## Unresolved risks / deferred items

- **M11 is fix-forward only** in production (account deletions tombstone profiles; `profiles_id_fkey` cannot return). Its `auth.users` trigger cannot be dropped with `DROP TRIGGER` by `postgres`, but is removed as a dependent object by `DROP FUNCTION private.handle_auth_user_deleting() CASCADE` — an emergency path only, never a reviewed rollback.
- GoTrue soft delete would bypass the deletion trigger; hard delete is the supported path.
- Orphaned groups (sole owner deleted their account) have zero active members and no cleanup/export path (DS-3).
- Expense and solo-group deletions are permanent; activity history is Phase 3.
- No expense edit UI (the update RPC is tested and deployed).
- No CI (checks are run locally); hosting undecided (G5).
- Accepted by design: add-by-email reveals an account only when it is added; membership RPC timing side channels (DS-10); `supabase_admin` default privileges not changeable by `postgres`.
- Three-way concurrency (deletion + transfer + add) reasoned, not tested.
- Frontend follow-ups from Phase 0 (Phase 2 scope): component tests, >500 kB chunk, stale data on route change, date validation, error wording; `api.mjs`/`api-batch2.mjs` still call the dropped legacy RPC (historical tools).
- M16 index cleanup deferred to Phase 8.

## Working-tree notes

`src/pages/ActivityPage.tsx`, `AuthPage.tsx` and `DashboardPage.tsx` had line-ending-only differences. Since a `git add src` on 2026-09-26 refreshed the index, they no longer show as modified. Their working-tree bytes are unchanged and they were never committed.
